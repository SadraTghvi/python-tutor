# python-tutor

This is my first project with backend lang (django), i hope this is going to be a good start for my fullstack road.


**how the site work:**
  by going to the main page there is a search input which you can search what ever you want to buy and it will redirect you to the "/new_search" and there should be a result.

this is a searching site using beatifull soup, which get data from another site and register it for the backend and will send it to front end give it some usefull UI

This site is not hosted anywhere yet but feel free to set it up on your local host by installing it. ðŸ–¤
